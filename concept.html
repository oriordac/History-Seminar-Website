                        <p>Rising anti-French sentiment inspired Ernst von Bandel, the architect of the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>,
                            to dedicate his whole life to the endeavor. Foreign occupying soldiers were a staple of Bandel’s
                            childhood, for he was born in Ansbach on May 17, 1800 when the French threat loomed over the
                            continent during the Napoleonic Wars. Some German scholars have speculated that Bandel’s 
                            inspiration of the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> originated from an altercation between a French troop and his
                            six year old self. The soldier “boxed” Bandel’s ears for being an insubordinate child. 
                            Years later in 1872, Gartenlaube, a popular German magazine of the late nineteenth century, 
                            published an article titled “A Creative Slap in the Face” inspired by this adolescent experience.<a href="#fn1" class="fn"><sup>1</sup></a>
                            Even if this account was nothing more than a fable, Bandel already had sketches of the 
                            <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> by his university years.<a href="#fn2" class="fn"><sup>2</sup></a> Something instrumental must have happened during his
                            formative years to spur him to spend the majority of his life constructing the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>.

                        <p>The inspiration for the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> originated from the Wars for Liberation when several
                            European territories united under a single banner to banish Napoleon from central Europe. 
                            In particular, the Battle of Nations, also known as the Battle of Leipzig or the Völkerschlacht, 
                            inspired Bandel and many other German nationalists for years to come. 
                            This conflict marked the shifting of the tides, for Napoleon suffered his first major defeat 
                            on the battlefield against the opposing coalition consisting of Prussia, Austria, Russia, 
                            Sweden, and other Germanic states. Until this battle, Napoleon’s only defeat had been a 
                            reluctant retreat from Russia the previous year. Bavaria, the state were Bandel’s hometown 
                            was located, betrayed its French allies by swearing allegiance to the opposing coalition 
                            just days before the fateful battle.<a href="#fn3" class="fn"><sup>3</sup></a> After several days, the coalition routed Napoleon from 
                            the city; the battle would be the largest conflict known to Europe until the World Wars. 
                            Since the Battle of Leipzig was such a turning point in the war against France, 
                            many festivals celebrated the Völkerschlacht as a second <em>Varusschlacht</em>.<a href="#fn4" class="fn"><sup>4</sup></a>
                            Consider Karl Russ’s 1818 drawing of Arminius rescuing the enchained Germania, 
                            the German nation personified, from the battlefield of Leipzig.<a href="#fn5" class="fn"><sup>5</sup></a>  
                            Not only does this drawing give credence to the importance of the <em>Varusschlacht</em> to a German 
                            audience, but it also makes clear the connection between Rome and France. 
                            Germania’s former captors clutch Roman standards in their cold, dead hands. 
                            Due to this parallel between the Völkerschlacht and the <em>Varusschlacht</em>, 
                            it is clear that the Wars for Liberation ignited a nationalistic fervor in Ernst von Bandel 
                            to dedicate thirty-seven years of his life to honor this second <em>Varusschlacht</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>The years leading up to the opening ceremony of the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> in 1875 require a brief 
                            contextualization since renewed interest in Arminius accompanied a national awakening. 
                            The cornerstone celebration for the monument occurred on September 8, 1841 followed by a 
                            recital of Mortiz Arndt’s patriotic song “What is the German’s Fatherland?”<a href="#fn6" class="fn"><sup>6</sup></a>  
                            Arndt was another German patriot inspired by the Battle of Nations; the Völkerschlachtdenkmal 
                            in Leipzig even pays homage to Arndt’s earlier designs for such a monument. 
                            Unfortunately for the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>, as soon as construction began, the project fell in 
                            desperate financial straits, so Bandel had to postpone the project and move to Hannover 
                            for more favourable work.<a href="#fn7" class="fn"><sup>7</sup></a> It was only after the Franco-Prussian War that funding began to 
                            flow again. In 1868, soon-to-be Kaiser Wilhelm I’s visit to Bandel’s workshop sparked 
                            renewed interest in the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>, and the Reichstag’s generous donation of 10,000 
                            talers spurred on further construction.  Though a large sum of money, that donation alone 
                            would not have covered the 90,000 talers cost.<a href="#fn8" class="fn"><sup>8</sup></a> Outside of other notable figures such as 
                            King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Prince Leopold of Lippe, public donations raised 
                            the remaining funds.

                        <p>This begs the question of how private citizens from across the newly formed German nation 
                            became aware of the monument’s construction and were willing to fund the outstanding deficit. 
                            After all, even after the monument’s completion, few tourists journeyed to the site; 
                            only about 1,500 to 1,800 annual visitors trekked into the forest to see the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> 
                            between 1875 and 1880. However, this number skyrocketed to 20,500 in 1895 and 41,000 in 1909 
                            thanks to the installation of a train station in Detmold.<a href="#fn9" class="fn"><sup>9</sup></a> These later visitors likely 
                            participated in fundraisers for the monument, but they were unable to visit this otherwise 
                            obscure monument. Historian Kirsten Belgum lays out a compelling argument that even though 
                            many Germans never saw these structures in the flesh, popular magazines such as Gartenlaube 
                            exposed the budding German nation to nationalistic monuments such as the Niederwalddenkmal 
                            and the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>. As Belgum points out, Gartenlaube enjoyed the largest circulation 
                            of any German-language publication at the time with 310,000 subscriptions by 1871.<a href="#fn10" class="fn"><sup>10</sup></a>
                        </p>
                        <p>Other advocates of the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> tapped into this budding national interest. 
                            Hans Ferdinand Massman, fast friends with Bandel, lobbied on the monument’s behalf. 
                            Massman himself published two books and several poems on Arminius which were quite popular 
                            with the public.<a href="#fn11" class="fn"><sup>11</sup></a>  Bandel also appealed to the top students from 300 grammar schools to 
                            contribute and gather donations in their local communities.<a href="#fn12" class="fn"><sup>12</sup></a> This would only have been 
                            successful if these schools instilled into children the mythological and nationalistic 
                            connotations surrounding Arminius. Eventually, the monument was inaugurated on August 16, 
                            1875 in the presence of the Kaiser and around 20,000 to 30,000 attendees.<a href="#fn13" class="fn"><sup>13</sup></a>  
                            Naturally, Gartenlaube printed a featurette on the festivities.<a href="#fn14" class="fn"><sup>14</sup></a>
