                        <p>In the autumn of AD 9, Arminius, a German chieftain, led an ambush against the Roman commander 
                            Publius Quinctilius Varus and the three lower Rhine legions in Teutoburg Forest. Depending on the 
                            ancient sources, the massacre lasted one to four days with around 15,000 Romans killed or enslaved.<a href="#fn1" class="fn"><sup>1</sup></a> 
                            In the aftermath, Emperor Augustus exclaimed this now famous line when news of the massacre reached 
                            Rome: “Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!”<a href="#fn2" class="fn"><sup>2</sup></a>  The battle sent shockwaves across the known world,
                            and the proceeding Germanic Wars would last several years. Centuries later, the Roman Empire would 
                            never reclaim their former hegemony in Germania, the territories and clans beyond the Rhine River.
                        </p>
                        <p>This battle, called the <em>clades Variana</em> (Varian disaster) in Latin, but more commonly known among
                            German historians as the <em>Varusschlacht</em> (Varus’s battle) or the <em>Hermannsschlacht</em> (Hermann’s battle), 
                            ranks among the greatest defeats of Rome. Though the <em>Varusschlacht</em> is a topic onto itself, the man 
                            who orchestrated the battle is more fascinating. Arminius, prince of the Cherusci Clan located near
                            modern-day Hannover, was a Romanized German in every sense of the word; he spoke Latin, fought in the
                            legions, and gained Roman citizenship.<a href="#fn3" class="fn"><sup>3</sup></a>  Up until the <em>Varusschlacht</em>, Arminius and the Cherusci were 
                            adamant Roman sympathizers. The ill-fated Varus even considered Arminius a trusted adviser. Despite
                            his elevated status in Roman society, Arminius threw it all away. He betrayed his Roman compatriots 
                            and led them to slaughter, for he instructed Varus to march his legions through Teutoburg Forest.<a href="#fn4" class="fn"><sup>4</sup></a>  
                            In response to the <em>Varusschlacht</em>, Tiberius and Germanicus, sons of the imperial family, launched 
                            several campaigns against the chieftain, but Arminius always evaded capture. Ironically, Arminius 
                            lost his life when he became what he most despised, a tyrannical king. His own clansmen murdered 
                            him in AD 21 in fear of Arminius’s kingly ambitions straying too far from their Germanic values.<a href="#fn5" class="fn"><sup>5</sup></a>

                    <div id="section2"> <!--Thesis-->
                        <p>The mythical potential of Arminius is boundless, for a foreigner stood against and annihilated
                            three Roman legions during the peak of the empire’s power. The Romans never outright defeated him
                            because Arminius’s clansmen betrayed the chieftain and killed him before Rome had the chance. 
                            It is no wonder that later Germans elevated Arminius, known by the German name Hermann, to near 
                            cult-like status as a national hero. Some German intellectuals from the sixteenth century onwards 
                            went as far as depicting Arminius as the ideal “German.”
                        </p>
                        <p>This paper analyzes the legacy of Arminius and his role as an exemplar of German virtues. 
                            In the pursuit of an ancient heritage, German humanists of the Middle Ages scoured the writings
                            of Roman historians and found Arminius and the Germani people. From language to culture, German 
                            intellectuals attempted to draw parallels between contemporary Germans and the Germani in the 
                            hopes of differentiating themselves from their Romanticized neighbours. As Arminius became a more
                            recognizable figure, different groups co-opted him as an ideological figurehead. For example, 
                            Nazi propaganda posters depict Adolf Hitler striking similar poses to popular imagery of Arminius.<a href="#fn6" class="fn"><sup>6</sup></a>
                            To comprehend German reception of Arminius, I will focus on the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> (Hermann’s Monument) 
                            in Detmold to gauge the public’s reception of Arminius. The research will focus on three 
                            overarching themes – how Romans and Germans differed on their views of Arminius as the ideal German,
                            how Arminius embodied the East-West divide as a symbol of anti-Roman sentiment, and the rise and fall
                            of nationalistic spirit surrounding the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> in Germany from the nineteenth century onwards.

                        <p>This research differs from other scholarship in two important aspects. The first is on the topic
                            of German virtue. In his work <em>A Most Dangerous Book</em>, historian Christopher Krebs writes extensively 
                            about the influence of Tacitus’s <em>Germania</em> on later German writers. Specifically, he explores the 
                            evolution of these tacitean German virtues into <em>völkisch</em> traits during the Third Reich. Though Krebs 
                            mentions Arminius, he does not appreciate the importance of Arminius in German reception. I will argue
                            that Arminius was the ideal role model because not only does he embody the dichotomy between western 
                            civilization and the “noble savage,” Arminius chooses his German heritage over his Roman upbringing. 
                            The second is in regards to the coverage of the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>. Most historians only discuss the 
                            monument’s history during the Second and Third Reich - very few consider reception in the twenty-first
                            century. The few articles that address the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> in a modern context lack the necessary 
                            historiography on German identity to tackle the extensive legacy of Arminius. Hence, I will consider 
                            if the nationalistic and ethnic connotations associated with the figure of Arminius have faded away 
                            in the modern age or if those negative memories linger.
                        </p>
                        <p>The theory of collective memory lends itself to this research on Roman and German reception, 
                            for one of the quintessential components of the theory relies on the relationship between memory
                            and identity. This applies to both the individual and the community, for memory, “…captures 
                            simultaneously the individual, embodied, and lived side and the collective, social, and 
                            constructed side of your relations to the past.”<a href="#fn7" class="fn"><sup>7</sup></a>  For example, consider the historical and 
                            cultural implications of the <em>Varusschlacht</em>. Many modern historians argue that the <em>Varusschlacht</em> 
                            had little to no influence on long-term Roman foreign policy. German historian Dieter Timpe 
                            expresses this sentiment succinctly: “One cannot, with any seriousness, attribute to a German 
                            chieftain the idea that he could bring about the fall of the Roman Empire or even of Roman rule 
                            north of the Alps!”<a href="#fn8" class="fn"><sup>8</sup></a>  Though the <em>Varusschlacht</em> may have been insignificant in Roman history, 
                            the battle had a profound impact on German identity. Arminius inspired future generations of 
                            Germans who viewed the Germani as their ancestors. Historians Christopher Krebs and Herbert 
                            Benario both note that German humanists found their <em>patria</em> (Latin for country) in the pages 
                            of Tacitus’s <em>Germania</em>, a missing component of German identity long denied to them due to a lack
                            of historical records.<a href="#fn9" class="fn"><sup>9</sup></a>  In essence, the study of collective memory relies on, “…a triad, 
                            a three-cornered relationship among highly resonant parts of a memory landscape, individuals, 
                            and groups...” who struggle to find meaning in the world around them.<a href="#fn10" class="fn"><sup>10</sup></a>
