Converting a history thesis into a website
---
Dear Professor Plotkin, 

Here is my history website designed in Bootstrap. To reiterate, I am attempting to use the Spyscroll feature of
Bootstrap to visual the different "sub-sections" of each chapter. This feature is used on intro.html, roman.html,
concept.html, ethnic.html, and modern.html. 

The spyscroll seems to only work when the class enclosing the text, in this case class="spy", has a height less than 100%. Currently, 
the height is set to 50%, and the spyscroll works; however, I would like the scroll from the browser to trigger the spyscroll - 
not the one caused by overflow-y property. 

Thank you very much for looking at this despite this being beyond the scope of the class. 

Sincerely, 

Conor O'Riordan
