                        <p>The monument remained physically the same in the immediate aftermath of the Third Reich, 
                            emerging unscathed from the carnage of WWII thanks to its isolated location in the woods. 
                            However, the public began to dissociate itself from the monument’s militant undertones. 
                            The seventy-fifth anniversary of the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> occurred in 1950, 
                            and the event provides a case-study in shifting attitudes towards the figure of Arminius 
                            soon after the war. Tourist numbers nosedived in comparison to the heights achieved during 
                            the Third Reich; however, 200,000 attendees were still impressive given the conditions 
                            of Germany at the time. It should be noted that President Theodor Huess of the 
                            Federal Republic of Germany (FDR) was not among the visitors.<a href="#fn1" class="fn"><sup>1</sup></a> 
                            The celebration was a somber one, and the ceremony ended with the installation of a plaque nearby the monument. 
                            The inscription reads: “German women and men unanimously profess on the occasion of the 
                            75th anniversary of the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> to the unification of the people through peace.”<a href="#fn2" class="fn"><sup>2</sup></a>  
                            The last interesting note from the ceremony was the lack of East German representation. 
                            The National Front, which represented the eastern political parties of the 
                            German Democratic Republic (GDR), refused to provide their city flags for the event. 
                            In contrast, 152 city flags from the FDR were available if need be.<a href="#fn3" class="fn"><sup>3</sup></a> 
                            Between the absence of President Huess and the National Front,
                            the political sway of the monument had begun to dissipate in both the West and East Germany.

                                Anselm Kiefer
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The vestiges of the <em>Varusschlacht</em> pathos now resided solely in the cultural spheres, 
                            and many artists attempted to confront this past through their work. 
                            In 1985, art historian Wieland Schmied stated that, “Of all contemporary German painters 
                            Anselm Kiefer is regards as the most ‘German.’ And in fact he is, more than any other artist, 
                            a painter of ‘German’ themes.”<a href="#fn4" class="fn"><sup>4</sup></a>
                            The German themes in question are his Hermannsschlacht series and his 
                            1976 painting titled <em>Varus</em>. Born in 1945, Kiefer represented the next generation of 
                            West Germans grappling with the fascist past, a concept known as Vergangenheitsbewältigung. 
                            While describing the Hermannsschlacht series, Mathew Rampley noted that, 
                            “In these paintings from the early 1970s one can…see how Kiefer is undertaking an 
                            interrogation of the intertwining of romanticism, nationalism and Nazism by 
                            highlighting common motifs and ideologemes.”<a href="#fn5" class="fn"><sup>5</sup></a>
                            Similarly, the <em>Varus</em> painting illustrates the legacy of the <em>Varusschlacht</em> mythos and 
                            its dangers. A wooded path leads deeper into the forest; the blood in the foreground, 
                            which resembles bullet holes, is the only indicator of the battle in the distance out of frame. 
                            This ominous setting runs counter to the importance of the forest, 
                            the supposed origin of the Germanic people according to Tacitus.<a href="#fn6" class="fn"><sup>6</sup></a>  
                            Amongst the branches of these painted trees are names of German authors, politicians, 
                            and playwrights such as Hutten, Grabbe, and Martin Luther who elevated the <em>Varusschlacht</em> 
                            to its cult-like status. These historical figures set Arminius on a trajectory to become 
                            a fascist icon. By acknowledging this dangerous lineage, Kiefer’s artistic works embody 
                            shifting western attitudes towards Arminius and this Teutonic tradition tainted in militarism.

                        <p>The shift away from German nationalism sentenced the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> to solitary confinement 
                            within the forest for decades. Only in recent years have Arminius emerged from the woods into 
                            the public sphere. This change was brought about during the age of consumerism when Arminius 
                            became the mascot for the Lippe region. Statues of Arminius now litter the streets of Detmold 
                            standing guard by the doors of many tourist shops. If the life-size model of Arminius is 
                            too intimidating, gnome versions of the Liberator of Germania are available to protect 
                            the lawn from Roman intruders.<a href="#fn7" class="fn"><sup>7</sup></a>
                            Tourist numbers for the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> have always been decent, but now, half a million 
                            annual visitors come to see the monument.<a href="#fn8" class="fn"><sup>8</sup></a>  The discovery of the true battlefield of the 
                            Varruschlacht at Kalkriese in 1987 certainly sparked renewed interest, 
                            but that alone does not explain the staying power of Arminius in recent memory. 
                            This begs the question of how Arminius re-emerged in the public imagination and if 
                            he retains any of his anti-Roman or anti-French connotations.

                        <p><em>Arminia Bielefeld</em>, the local soccer organization, was the driving force that sustained 
                            Arminius’s positive image. Advertisements for <em>Arminia</em> often depict the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>
                            wearing the club’s jersey. This was taken quite literally in 1999 when the Arminius statue 
                            was dressed in the largest soccer jersey ever created for two weeks.<a href="#fn9" class="fn"><sup>9</sup></a>  
                            Featuring the number nine in reference to the year of the <em>Varusschlacht</em>, 
                            this commercial stunt cemented Arminius’s association with soccer. 
                            This may be why the <em>Lippisches Landesmuseum</em> commissioned a recreation of Arminius’s left foot 
                            as part of their advertisement campaign for their 2009 “Myth: Exhibition" in Detmold.<a href="#fn10" class="fn"><sup>10</sup></a>

                        <p><em>Arminia</em> fully embraces the figure of Arminius and all that he stands for. 
                        On their website, the organization likens the <em>Varusschlacht</em> to a soccer match where Rome 
                        is the visiting team while the Germani defend their home turf:

                        <p>As a local military hero, Arminius is a fitting mascot for a sports team. 
                            Though clearly in jest, the tone is eerily similar to the rhetoric employed by the fascists. 
                            Despite the embrace of Arminius as a marketing tool, some local Germans still feel uneasy. 
                            This is evident by the display of Arminius’s left foot commissioned by the Detmold museum. 
                            It is the left foot of the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> that crushes the Roman eagle and fasces 
                            into submission, but this recreation is only the foot – no Roman symbols in sight. 
                            This is notable because the creator chose the left foot with these connotations over 
                            the right foot which has absolutely no meaning attached to it. 
                            There is also the case for several of the Arminius statues in town; some of miniature 
                            recreations have the original design of Arminius stomping on the Roman eagle and fasces while 
                            others removed the Roman emblems underfoot entirely.
                        </p>
                        <p>This tension was also present in the 2000th anniversary of the <em>Varusschlacht</em> in 2009. 
                        The seventy-fifth anniversary of the inauguration ceremony of the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> in 1950 
                        provides a good foil to modern German reception during this fifty-nine year time span. 
                        Unlike President Heuss in 1950, Chancellor Angela Merkel travelled to the Kalkriese exhibit to 
                        enjoy the festivities. Gisela Söger, a public relation staffer for the Kalkriese museum, 
                        said this: “…the myth of Hermann has lost its power in modern Germany. The old nationalism has 
                        been replaced by an easy-going patriotism that mainly manifests itself at sporting events like 
                        the soccer World Cup.”<a href="#fn12" class="fn"><sup>12</sup></a>  However, a reenactment of the <em>Varusschlacht</em> at Kalkriese says otherwise. 
                        As Der Spiegel reported, “some 400 actors dressed as Romans or Germanic tribesmen gently 
                        re-enacted scenes… Most actors wanted to be Romans, and there was such a shortage of Germanic 
                        warriors that some hirsute hobby Vikings had to be recruited to make up the numbers.”<a href="#fn13" class="fn"><sup>13</sup></a>  
                        These reenactors would rather be “slaughtered” as Romans than be associated with the Germanic victors.
                        The commercialization of Arminius should have redeemed the chieftain in the eyes of the public, 
                        for Arminius’s mascot status should have normalized and weakened his past ties to nationalism. 
                        However, this is still not the case, for the <em>Varusschlacht</em> myth seems to still hold sway over 
                        modern Germans.
