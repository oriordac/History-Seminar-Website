                        <p>Though inspired by Arminius, the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> was very much a product of its time. 
                            The statue towers above the forest landscape at 24.82 m; when taking the base into account, 
                            the whole monument is 53.44 m.<a href="#fn1" class="fn"><sup>1</sup></a>  Arminius wears Roman military attire, but that is the only 
                            Roman element. Donning a winged helmet and a full beard, Arminius raises a mighty sword 
                            skywards as if to issue a challenge towards his foes. Etched on the sword are these words: 
                            “GERMAN UNITY, MY STRENGTH; MY STRENGTH, GERMANY’S MIGHT.”<a href="#fn2" class="fn"><sup>2</sup></a>  
                            It is important to note that <em>Deutschland</em>, not <em>Germania</em>, is inscribed on the blade. 
                            The word <em>Deutschland</em> represents modern-day Germany as a nation-state – a word Arminius 
                            would have never known. As Dutch novelist noted, “He [Arminius] did not know that Germany existed,
                            so he could not know that he had liberated it…History, that old anachronistic liar, 
                            is up to its old tricks again.”<a href="#fn3" class="fn"><sup>3</sup></a> Carved onto his shield is the word Truefest 
                            meaning “faithful-firm.”<a href="#fn4" class="fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> Lastly, Arminius’s left foot stands atop a Roman legionary eagle 
                            and fasces, symbols of Rome’s governmental and military might.
                        </p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>One would expect the statue to face southward towards Rome, but surprisingly, 
                            Arminius and his sword point westward towards France. The descriptions below in the niches 
                            of the monument’s base solidify France as the modern embodiment of the Roman Empire. 
                            The first inscription reads as follows:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p class="mb-0">Only because the German people had become too French and powerless through 
                                disunity could Napoleon Bonaparte Emperor of the French subjugate Germany with the aid of Germans; 
                                then finally in 1813 all German tribes gathered around the sword raised high by Prussia, 
                                from disgrace victoriously fighting for their home country’s freedom.<a href="#fn5" class="fn"><sup>5</sup></a>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Napoleon was only able to conquer Germany with the assistance of other Germans which is 
                            similar to how Rome ruled Germania with the assistance of other Germanic clans such 
                            as the Cherusci. Though it was easy to portray the Wars for Liberation as the tale of 
                            Europe against France, the ethnicity of the troops led by Napoleon were not as clear cut. 
                            Bandel’s hometown may have sided with Prussia in its time of need, but there were many 
                            “Germans” fighting alongside the French. For example, the Confederation of the Rhine 
                            aided Napoleon during the Battle of Nations. Nevertheless, the emphasis on German unity 
                            against foreign threats and internal enemies is reminiscent of the <em>Varusschlacht</em> myth. 
                            The second inscription honours Kaiser Wilhelm I and ties his legacy to Arminius:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p class="mb-0">He who united long divided tribes by a strong hand, he who victoriously 
                                overcame ‘Welsh’ might and malice, he who takes long-lost sons home to the German empire, 
                                he is equal to Arminius the rescuer.”<a href="#fn6" class="fn"><sup>6</sup></a>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Directly above this passage is a metallic relief of the Kaiser crafted from bronze originating
                            from French cannons captured during the Franco-Prussian War.<a href="#fn7" class="fn"><sup>7</sup></a> This was a common tradition at 
                            this point, for cannons adorned the column of the Siegessäule in Berlin. 
                            On the other hand, the context of the <em>Varusschlacht</em> breathes ancient meaning into this 
                            new tradition; just as Arminius stole three Roman standards from the fallen legions, 
                            the Kaiser pillaged and robbed France of its military might. In this sense, 
                            the passage draws an obvious parallel between the Kaiser and Arminius.

                        <p>However, what truly makes this second inscription provoking is the usage of the term <em>welsch</em> 
                            rather than französisch, the standard adjective for French. <em>Welsch</em> is synonymous with the 
                            adjective römisch (Roman), but <em>welsch</em> carries a more negative connotation and was often 
                            used to describe foreigners. The famous German historian Theodor Massmann wrote this in 
                            regards to the words <em>deutsch</em> and <em>welsch</em>:
                        </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p class="mb-0">The two adjectives <em>deutsch</em> and <em>welsch</em>, about which a biography of their own 
                            could be written, have meant, through all centuries, a significant, almost moral, antithesis. 
                            Specifically, the elevating use of the word <em>deutsch</em>, which stands for everything that is noble 
                            in man and a true power for peace, allows us to look into a mirror of a people’s self-confidence
                            as well as human equilibrium.<a href="#fn8" class="fn"><sup>8</sup></a>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Just as the first inscription makes reference to the German people succumbing to a 
                            foreign power due to being too French, the conflict between <em>deutsch</em> and <em>welsch</em> once raged 
                            on within Arminius. Though a German who lived among the Romans, Arminius maintained his <em>deutsch</em> 
                            virtues and never succumbed to <em>welsch</em> temptations unlike his other family members. 
                            In the eyes of nineteenth century Germans, Arminius was their exemplar.

                        <p>It is evident that the <em>welsch</em> connotation runs deeper in German collective memory than just 
                            the Wars for Liberation. Several German plays throughout the centuries contrasted the figure 
                            of Arminius to the Francophile trends of early modern Germany. Justus Georg Schottelius’s play 
                            The Victory of Peace was very much a product of its time; Schottelius wrote it in the midst 
                            of the Thirty Years’ War around 1642. In the play, the character Arminius laments the fall 
                            of the German people when confronting Bolderian, a modern German. Krebs summarizes 
                            Bolderian’s appearance as such: “Neat and groomed (with two plumes to his hat, puffy sleeves, 
                            knee-high boots, and a sword for ornament), he speaks the language of the day. German it seems, 
                            is the syntax, but French, mostly, the words.” In contrast, Arminius possesses long hair, 
                            a bearded face, and a real sword – features Bolderian openly mocks him for.<a href="#fn9" class="fn"><sup>9</sup></a>  
                            The contrast between the superior <em>deutsch</em> warrior and the <em>welsch</em> pretender is obvious. 
                            Almost every major production featuring Arminius presented similar comparisons and 
                            manifestations of these <em>deutsch</em> versus <em>welsch</em> qualities; Grabbe labelled Varus as 
                            <em>der welsche Oberfeldherr</em> (the welsch commander-in-chief) in his <em>Hermannsschlacht</em> 1835 production, 
                            and Klopstock painted the Romans in an effeminate light during his Arminius trilogy around 1769.<a href="#fn10" class="fn"><sup>10</sup></a>  
                            The repeated use of the word <em>welsch</em> to criticize French norms made it clear that Germans 
                            associated undesirable qualities with French and Roman values.

                        <p>In this <em>Kulturkampf</em> (battle for civilization) between <em>deutsch</em> and <em>welsch</em> society, 
                            Arminius defends Germany against the Roman vipers.  This metaphor has been consistent throughout 
                            history. The earliest known mention of Roman vipers in a German context first appeared in 1517. 
                            An artist by the name of Ambrosius Holbien produced a woodcut for the cover of 
                            Johannes Froben’s 1520 edition of Velleius Paterculus’s <em>Roman History</em>. 
                            Holbien clades Arminius in sixteenth-century armour confronting Varus on the battlefield 
                            alongside this quote: “Tandem vipera sibilare desiste – 
                            ‘finally this viper must desist from hissing.’”<a href="#fn11" class="fn"><sup>11</sup></a>
                        </p>
                        <p>The image of a snake harkens back to Roman historians who used the term viper to describe 
                            Romans and their German sympathizers. In this passage, Florus describes the aftermath of the 
                            <em>Varusschlacht</em> and how the Germani tortured the remaining legionaries: 
                            “They put out the eyes of some of them [the legionaries] and cut off the hands of others; 
                            they sewed up the mouth of one of them after first cutting out his tongue, exclaiming, 
                            ‘At last, you viper, you have ceased to hiss.’”<a href="#fn12" class="fn"><sup>12</sup></a> 
                            This label was also applied to Germans aligned with the Roman Empire. 
                            In Tacitus’s account, Arminius and Maroboduus are exchanging insults before a skirmish. 
                            Maroboduus was once an enemy of Rome, but he threw his lot in with the Romans against his 
                            Germanic brothers. Arminius describes his rival as, “the fugitive who, without one stricken field, 
                            had lain safe in the coverts of the Hercynian Forest.”<a href="#fn13" class="fn"><sup>13</sup></a> Though not an obvious reference to a snake,
                            A.J. Woodman argues that Tacitus description of Maroboduus’s hiding place is a reference 
                            to Virgil’s <em>Georgics</em>, in which Virgil describes a skulking snake as 
                            frustra defensa latebris uipera (the viper vainly protected by its lair).<a href="#fn14" class="fn"><sup>14</sup></a>  
                            In a similar vein, Paterculus likens Maroboduus to a viper biding his time to strike.<a href="#fn15" class="fn"><sup>15</sup></a>  
                            Though Woodman cautions that this snake metaphor may be a coincidence in these ancient sources, 
                            later Germans, who were familiar with these texts, would have known the underlying cultural 
                            connotations of such loaded terminology, and these Germans used these allusions to identify 
                            and defame their enemies.<a href="#16" class="fn"><sup>16</sup></a>

                        <p>This metaphor remerged in the nineteenth-century in association with the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>, 
                            for German invoked Arminius and Martin Luther against German Roman Catholics. 
                            Though the word Kulturkampf means a struggle for civilization, the term also describes a 
                            period from 1872 to 1886 when the new German government, specifically Otto von Bismarck, 
                            was at odds with the Roman Catholic Church. In 1870, Pope Pius IX declared the dogma of 
                            papal infallibility binding the loyalty of German Catholics to the Vatican first and 
                            Germany second.<a href="#fn17" class="fn"><sup>17</sup></a> The May Laws of 1873 marked the German offence against Catholics, 
                            for these laws gave authority to the state governments to veto Catholic appointments 
                            to public offices.<a href="#fn18" class="fn"><sup>18</sup></a> These religious tensions were present at the inauguration ceremony 
                            for the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> during the height of the Kulturkampf. The Lippe regional government 
                            distributed the poem “The <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> in Teutoburg Forest” by Leopold Böhmer in their 
                            pamphlets during the ceremony.<a href="#fn19" class="fn"><sup>19</sup></a> The poem not only associates the Roman Empire with the 
                            Catholic Church, but Böhmer declares a call to arms against the internal Catholic enemies. 
                            Furthermore, the ceremony ends with this message: “Here we find ourselves together in the 
                            shadow of ancient oaks and beeches and shake ours hand within a small covenant of brothers 
                            under the leadership of our heroic Kaiser and his co-conspirators against Rome’s vipers.”<a href="#fn20" class="fn"><sup>20</sup></a>  
                            This was not an isolated event in Detmold alone. The day before the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>’s 
                            inauguration ceremony, Kladderadatsch, a magazine based in Berlin, 
                            published an image of Arminius and Martin Luther standing together.<a href="#fn21" class="fn"><sup>21</sup></a>  
                            Though the word Truefest is on the monument’s shield, this image depicts the word Vici 
                            (Latin for victory) on Arminius’s shield. Just as Arminius and Martin Luther vanquished 
                            their Roman foes, the modern German nation would emerge victorious from this Kulturkampf. 
                            This modern religious conflict bestowed new meaning on the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em>; 
                            instead of an external danger, the <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> now raised his sword against 
                            the Roman Catholic invaders who have infiltrated Germany.
                        </p>
                        <p>This internal enemy soon shifted from German Catholics to German Jews, for fascists used the 
                            <em>Hermannsdenkmal</em> and the <em>welsch</em> label to defame the Jewish population during the Third Reich. 
                            The National Socialists campaigned heavily in the Lippe region during the 1933 elections, 
                            and many speeches compared Hitler to Arminius.<a href="#fn22" class="fn"><sup>22</sup></a>  
                            Some historians warn against the temptation to overinflate Arminius’s place in 
                            National Socialism; however, continued productions of Grabbe’s and Kleist’s <em>Hermannsschlacht</em>
                            plays testify to the staying power of the <em>Varusschlacht</em> during the Nazi Regime.<a ref="#fn23" class="fn"><sup>23</sup></a>  
                            Similar to how previous regimes politicized the <em>Varusschlacht</em> myth, Arminius’s demise 
                            at the hands of his clansmen set the historical precedent for the <em>Dolchstosslegende</em>. 
                            An anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, the <em>Dolchstosslegende</em> claims that Germany would have won WWI 
                            if the German Jews did not “stab” Germany in the back. Just as Arminius fell to the daggers 
                            of his fellow clansmen, the nation too lost the war due to treachery. 
                            The Jews were labelled <em>welsch</em> like all the other enemies of Germany - <em>verwelscht</em> and <em>verjudet</em> 
                            (ruined by Jews) became synonymous with one another.<a href="#fn24" class="fn"><sup>24</sup></a>  
                            This may be why books published in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries discussing 
                            the “Jewish Question” often depicted a snake. 
                            However, this line of questioning is beyond the scope of this paper.
