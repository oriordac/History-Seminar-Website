                        <p>Before delving into modern reception of the <em>Varusschlacht</em>, one must consider the man responsible
                            for Arminius’s popularity from antiquity. Tacitus wrote extensively on the campaigns waged against
                            Arminius by Germanicus in Book I and II of his <em>Annals</em>. Other Roman historians discuss Arminius, but 
                            their writings pale in comparison to Tacitus’s depiction of Arminius. Unlike other historians, Tacitus
                            portrays the chieftain as a fleshed out character who has his own hopes and aspirations. Arminius is 
                            not only the liberator of Germany, but he is also a loyal husband and a competent warrior.<a href="#fn1" class="fn"><sup>1</sup></a>  
                            For example, Arminius flies into a fit of rage upon hearing that Germanicus has captured his pregnant
                            wife Thusenlda in AD 15.<a href="#fn2" class="fn"><sup>2</sup></a> Though unbecoming of a military leader, it is a humanizing moment for 
                            the chieftain and speaks to his devotion to Thusenlda. Tacitus’s Arminius is also a competent 
                            leader; he combats Rome’s superior numbers with brilliant tactics, such as directing his forces 
                            to divert the streams and rivers to terraform the terrain into marshlands.<a href="#fn3" class="fn"><sup>3</sup></a>  Bogged down in 
                            unfamiliar conditions, the legionaries fall victim to the Germani. Above all, Tacitus’s Arminius
                            possesses virtus, a concept usually reserved for Romans. Usually defined as exhibiting valour on
                            the battlefield, Arminius proves his virtus in combat as illustrated when Germanicus confronts 
                            Arminius’s army: “[The] Cherusci were being pushed from the hills — among them the unmistakable
                            figure of Arminius, striking, shouting, bleeding, in his effort to maintain the struggle.”<a href="#fn4" class="fn"><sup>4</sup></a>  
                            Though Arminius opposes Rome, Tacitus portrays him as a worthy adversary and a virtuous warrior.

                    <div id="section2"> <!--Other Roman Historians-->
                        <p>In contrast, other ancient historians treat Arminius with contempt and place the full blame of
                            the <em>Varusschlacht</em> squarely on Varus’s shoulders. In his <em>Epitome of Roman History</em>, Florus 
                            juxtaposes the virtuous Drusus, previous governor of Germania, against the cruel Varus.<a href="#fn5" class="fn"><sup>5</sup></a>
                            Florus even compares Varus to Paullus, the defeated consul from the Battle of Cannae.<a href="#fn6" class="fn"><sup>6</sup></a>  
                            Cassius Dio recounts the Varusschlahct in a similar manner. He argues that one could see the
                            gradually societal change of the Germani people under Drusus; however, Varus strove to make the
                            transition faster by imposing stricter enforcement of Roman law.<a href="#fn7" class="fn"><sup>7</sup></a>  Both Cassius Dio and Florus 
                            attribute Varus’s strict rule as the catalyst to the <em>Varusschlacht</em>. On the other hand, very few
                            ancient historians give credit to Arminius’s role in facilitating the ambush. These Romans argue
                            that Arminius had no influence, for he and the Germani would never have rebelled under a 
                            competent leader like Drusus. In this sense, Arminius is a faceless man who lacks personal 
                            motivation to rebel against the Romans – only Varus is to blame.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="section3"> <!--Paterculus-->
                        <p>Velleius Paterculus, a contemporary of the <em>Varusschlacht</em>, is the only ancient historian 
                            besides Tacitus who gives some credence to Arminius’s aptitude. Paterculus describes him as,
                            “…a young man of noble birth, brave in action and alert in mind, possessing an intelligence 
                            quite beyond the ordinary barbarian…and he showed in his countenance and in his eyes the fire
                            of the mind within.”<a href="#fn8" class="fn"><sup>8</sup></a>  In contrast, Paterculus notes all of Varus’s flaws – his slow wit, 
                            his poor track record as the former governor of Syria, and his preference to litigating from 
                            the camp rather than actual combat.<a href="#fn9" class="fn"><sup>9</sup></a>  Even though Paterculus recognizes Arminius’s abilities,
                            Paterculus still rests the blame of the <em>Varusschlacht</em> solely on Varus just like Cassius Dio 
                            and Florus did later. Since Paterculus considers Varus’s incompetence as the reason for the 
                            impending disaster, Arminius is nothing more than an opportunist. Paterculus acknowledges 
                            Arminius’s fervor, but the German served as an instrument of fortune to punish Varus. 
                            This is a common theme throughout all the accounts discussing the massacre. Even in the arts, 
                            the poet Manilius correlates the gods’ disapproval of Rome with the convulsion of the natural 
                            order: "…savage Germany carried off General Varus and drenched the fields with the 
                            blood of three legions. Then threatening lights were burning all over the firmament, 
                            and nature herself waged war by means of these fiery lights, opposed her powers to us, 
                            and threatened the end."<a href="#fn10" class="fn"><sup>10</sup></a> Likewise, Cassius Dio recounts several omens
                            that occurred before and after the <em>Varusschlacht</em>, such as the temple of Mars being struck by
                            lightning - the heavens were against Rome.<a href="#fn11" class="fn"><sup>11</sup></a> Despite Paterculus recognizing Arminius
                            as an individual, the chieftain serves as a pawn of fate to punish Rome for its own incompetence.

                    <div id="section4"> <!--Tacitus' Germania-->
                        <p>Unlike other ancient historians, Tacitus’s more sympathetic outlook toward Arminius was likely
                            colored by his earlier works on the Germani. Tacitus’s wrote several histories before the <em>Annals</em>;
                            one of those books was the <em>Germania</em>, an ethnography of the territories beyond the Rhine. 
                            In the Germania, Tacitus praises the Germani for their fighting spirit and their morality. 
                            He goes as far as equating German arms to the Roman toga, the quintessential symbol of manhood
                            and citizenship - high praise for “barbarians.”<a href="#fn12" class="fn"><sup>12</sup></a>  In regards to morality, Tacitus discusses at 
                            length the marriage and social customs of the Germani and applauds their chastity and devotion.
                            Though primarily a veiled criticism towards the social decadence of his fellow Romans, 
                            Tacitus concludes that, “good morality is more effective there than good laws elsewhere.”<a href="#fn13" class="fn"><sup>13</sup></a>

                        </figure>
                        <p>With the ethnography in mind, one should go back and compare Tacitus’s portrayal of Arminius 
                            to the characteristics Tacitus admires in the <em>Germania</em>. Tacitus’s gleaming appraisal of Arminius 
                            in the <em>Annals</em> begins to fade, for many of the chieftain’s actions contradict his supposedly 
                            German values. Arminius unknowingly airs these contradictions in a speech to his soldiers 
                            saying that, “Before his own sword three legions, three generals, had fallen. 
                            For he practiced war, not by the help of treason nor against pregnant women, 
                            but in open day against men who carried arms.”<a href="#fn14" class="fn"><sup>14</sup></a> The paradox is obvious. 
                            Arminius did not defeat Varus in open combat. Instead, he betrayed Varus, and he led the legions
                            into an ambush. Arminius facilitated his greatest achievement, the <em>Varusschlacht</em>, 
                            with cloaks and daggers rather than with swords and shields. Though later Germans claimed
                            that Tacitus presents Arminius in a favorable light, the conception that Tacitus greatly 
                            admired Arminius begins to fade.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="section5"> <!--Tacitus' Arminius Reevaluated-->
                        <p>These contradictions appear regularly throughout the <em>Annals</em>. According to the <em>Germania</em>, 
                            fleeing the battlefield is the greatest shame possible for a German warrior; however, 
                            Arminius evades capture for twelve years by fleeing the battlefield, a shameful act.<a href="#fn15" class="fn"><sup>15</sup></a>  
                            Even his marriage with Thusnelda flies in the face of German tradition. Though Tacitus makes
                            clear their devotion to one another, she was originally betrothed to another, 
                            so their arrangement defies social norms according to the <em>Germania</em>.<a href="#fn16" class="fn"><sup>16</sup></a>
                            The only remaining admirable traits that Tacitus praises, Arminius’s military strategies and 
                            his virtus, are not German traits. Rather, Arminius’s time in the Roman legion fostered his 
                            fighting spirit and tactical mind. The once rosy depiction of Tacitus’s Arminius continues 
                            to falter under scrutiny.

                        </figure>
                        <p>Tacitus’s subsequent account of Germanicus stumbling upon the remnants of the fallen legions
                            in Teutoburg Forest illustrates the monstrosity of Arminius. Tacitus claims that, 
                            “In the plain between were bleaching bones, scattered or in little heaps, as the men had fallen,
                            fleeing or standing fast. Hard by lay splintered spears and limbs of horses, while human 
                            skulls were nailed prominently on the tree-trunks.”<a href="#fn17" class="fn"><sup>17</sup></a> 
                            Not only is this a gruesome scene, but certain phrases, such as the white bones, 
                            allude to Book IV and XII of Virgil’s epic when Aeneas recounts the sack of Troy.<a href="#fn18" class="fn"><sup>18</sup></a>  
                            The vivid imagery and references to the Illiupersis testify to the depravity and 
                            cruelty of Arminius and his men. The chieftain slaughtered thousands of Romans, 
                            so it would be naïve to assume the Tacitus would hold anything but contempt towards Arminius. 
                            On the surface, it may seem that Tacitus’s Arminius is different from other historians’ accounts.
                            Tacitus occasionally does praise the chieftain. On the other hand, Tacitus’s portrayal of 
                            Arminius runs counter to Tacitus’s own depiction of a virtuous German in his <em>Germania</em>. 
                            In the end, Arminius is both the turbulator and liberator of Germany – an ambitious man with 
                            many personal flaws.<a href="#fn19" class="fn"><sup>19</sup></a>

                        <p>From the ancient sources alone, it is difficult to square away the admiration for Arminius 
                            by later Germans and the chieftain’s disregard for Germanic traditions. However, 
                            The German humanists of the sixteenth century looked past these flaws and focused solely 
                            on the good. Consider Ulrich von Hutten’s <em>Arminius</em> dialogues, a continuation of
                            Lucian’s <em>Dialogues of the Dead</em> where Minos must decide who was the greatest general
                            to ever live – Alexander, Scipio, or Hannibal. Hutten revises the trial by introducing Arminius
                            into the competition, and he calls Tacitus as a character witness. 
                            Tacitus quotes the <em>Annals</em> verbatim by focusing on how Arminius defeated Rome at the height 
                            of its power. Mercury verifies Tacitus’s assertions by claiming Tacitus to be the most 
                            trustworthy of historians.<a href="#fn20" class="fn"><sup>20</sup></a> In Hutten’s iteration, Tacitus sincerely admired Arminius. 
                            This is essential because by claiming Tacitus speaks the truth, 
                            Hutten dismisses all the other historians who are critical of Arminius.
                        </p>
                        <p>When the other generals accused Arminius of betraying his Roman compatriots and 
                            succumbing to tyrannical tendencies, Arminius defends himself. On the charge of treachery, 
                            Arminius argues,
                        </p>

                                to be prepared, should the occasion present itself, to free my fellow Germans who were bound

                        <p>On the accusation of tyranny, Arminius appeals to the logos of the audience saying,</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">

                                He who attends to the highest matters of state must necessarily have more influence 
                                and power over the people he rules.<a href="#22" class="fn"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

                        <p>Because the Hutten’s dialogues are set in the court of the underworld, 
                            everything that Arminius and Tacitus said must be true, so Arminius never truly served the 
                            Romans nor did he ever harbor kingly ambition. In these two rebuttals, 
                            Hutten absolves Arminius of his two most glaring character flaws. 
                            Thus, Hutten whitewashes Tacitus’s version of Arminius, a nuanced character with human flaws 
                            but hopeful aspirations, into this flawless exemplar of German virtues.

                        <p>Though Ulrich von Hutten’s <em>Arminius</em> is only one example, it speaks to how malleable these 
                            ancient sources are in the hands of ideologues. German authors focused on the good and ignored 
                            the flaws. Germans turned this once nuanced character into a caricature. With each simplification,
                            the story of Arminius and the <em>Varusschlacht</em> resembled myth more than history. 
                            Eventually, Arminius was nothing more than the exemplar of German virtue and the 
                            steadfast opponent of all things Roman - Italians, the French, or Roman Catholics, 
                            the chieftain did not discriminate.
